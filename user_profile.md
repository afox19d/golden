This will contain all the attributes and information about how to create and maintain the user profile.

Users must be identified by the IDSync API before you can maintain the profile and associate attributes and tags. 

User Identity: various events may trigger a change in the key used to identify users. The logic is as follows;
- app open -> anonymous ID 
- login or account creation -> Logged in SWID -> mParticle CustomerID


User Tag: is a label or category to which the user belongs
User Attribute: value associated to describe the user profile. Can accept lists or strings
